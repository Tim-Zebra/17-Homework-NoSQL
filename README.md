# Social Network

## Description
A backend social network that allows you to add, remove, update, and delete users/thoughts. Users can post thoughts and everyone may "react" to those thoughts. In addition to posting reactions, users may also add friends. Users can add or delete friends/reactions incase relationships go sour or a reaction was made hastily and needs to be removed. <br /> <br />
